        "\n",
        "Recent advances in drone technology have revolutionized the remote sensing community by providing means to collect fine spatial and high temporal resolutions at affordable costs. As people are gaining access to increasingly larger volumes of drone and satellite geospatial data products, there is a growing need to extract relevant information from the vast amount of freely available geospatial data. However, the lack of specialized software packages tailored for processing such data makes it challenging to develop transdisciplinary research collaboration around them. This workshop aims to bridge the gap between big geospatial data and research scientists by providing training on an open-source online platform for managing big drone data known as Data to Science.\n",

        "The main topics to be covered in this workshop include:\n",

        "* Create interactive maps using leafmap\n",
        "* Visualize drone imagery from D2S\n",
        "* Automated segmentation of drone imagery using SAMGeo\n",
